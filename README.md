I am a Developer Relations Engineer at Neo4j, focused on Java/JVM technologies. Technology fascinates me, and I love sharing what I learn with others as a conference speaker, content writer, and other channels. I write frequently on my website [jmhreif.com](https://jmhreif.com/), tweet occasionally at [@JMHReif](https://twitter.com/JMHReif), and always publish code to my [JMHReif Github](https://github.com/JMHReif)!
